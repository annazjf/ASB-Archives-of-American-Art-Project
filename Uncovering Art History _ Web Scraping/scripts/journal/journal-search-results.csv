The works of Davies, Kuhn, MacRae, Myers, and Taylor were overshadowed by the usual recitations of information about the avant-garde European art on view. One critic observed that when “one remembers what they borrowed, it comes as something of a shock to walk into the Hirshhorn and see the sort of pictures, mild, unadventurous, that they produced themselves.”3*° Another show at the New York offices of the Archives of American Art and accompanying publication of archival material provided further acknowledgment of this “most important single occasion in American art history.”3*’ Since Kuhn's personal correspondence was still unknown when Brown's book was published, its discovery prompted the art historian to write the groundbreaking article “Walt Kuhn’s Armory Show” upon this occasion, published in a special issue of the Archives of American Art Journal, along with other relevant archival material. Surprised at the lack of advance publicity and projects associated with the 75th anniversary of the Armory Show, Brown asked whether its legendary appeal was fading and attributed the casting of its “mythic guise” to Kuhn’s pamphlet.3®* Brown did not pursue much further the archival materials in the revised second edition of his book, also in 1988, except to provide “minor emendations.”3*9 Therefore, his few comments on American art and its reception remained couched in such generalizations as the critical applause for “the sanity of the American section in contrast to the wildness of the radical Europeans.”39°""}, {'Page 51': ""“t On Kent's mysterious exclusion, see Kenneth Miller's letter to Rockwell Kent, March 23, 1913, published in Archives of American Art Journal Vol. 27 Number 2 (1987), 31.

That Hartley could not understand Kandinsky’s Concerning the Spiritual in Art points to Hartley’s essentially rudimentary facility in German. Hartley readily admitted this lack to Stieglitz in December 1912 and Franz Marc in June 1913. Therefore, Hartley’s understanding of Kandinsky’s text before 1914 would have been purely general. Arnold Rénnebeck was available for some help with translation. Nevertheless, the language deficiency hampered Hartley’s integration into German artistic circles. He gained his first access to a truly intimate knowledge of Kandinsky’s specific ideas in April 1914, when he finally received and read Concerning the Spiritual in Art in English translation. He then confessed to Stieglitz that he found in it “some things a little over done on the side of the spiritual,” June 12, 1914 WCA Michael T.

Sasha Newman, in ARTHUR DOVE AND DUNCAN PHILLIPS: ARTIST AND PATRON (1981), focuses much of her attention on the former, although she does include a discussion of how his illustration style influenced his fine art, particularly the design elements of his illustrations. And the book does contain a selected bibliography of his work. Barbara Gallati (ARCHIVES OF AMERICAN ART JOURNAL [1981]), on the other hand, focuses on Dove as an illustrator. She divides his illustration career into two periods, broken by a trip to Europe to study painting and a commitment to fine art when he returned. In 1919, after almost ten years of trying, he realized the need to do illustration to make a living, although it was not until the mid1920s that he became committed to illustration and de¬ veloped a more mature style. Shortly thereafter, however, the demand for illus¬ trations declined and Dove resumed his fine art career once again. The Gallati article is useful for the insight it provides on Dove’s relations with other artistillustrators in New York City and the relatioriship between his illustration and fine art careers and their respective styles. Gail Levin’s EDWARD HOPPER AS ILLUSTRATOR (1979) fills an important gap in our knowledge of Hopper’s artistic career and shows the conflicts — financial and artistic — between the role of illustrator and fine artist. It is interesting to compare Hopper’s business and restaurant illustrations with the stark Urban Realism of his later fine art — making it easy to see the thread that ties his fine art and illustration artwork together.'}, {'Page 112': 'Gallati, Barbara D. “Arthur Dove as Illustrator.” ARCHIVES OF AMERICAN ART JOURNAL, no. 21 (1981), 13-22.'}, {'Page 151': 'ARCHIVES OF AMERICAN ART JOURNAL.

Monroe’s essay ‘Art Front’ in Archives of American Art Journal, vol. 13, no. 3, 1973, pp. 13-19. The editorial board’s shift towards modernism was made partly as a result of pressure which had been brought to bear by some modernist members of the Union — Solman, Ilya Bolotowsky, Balcomb Greene, Mark Rothkowitz, Byron Browne, George McNeil, and others — and partly because the Popular Front made it necessary to open up the editorial board to modernism. The move did not go uncontested. Rosenberg’s place was secured at the expense of Solman’s and Spivak’s and several others, and then only on the advice of a visiting official of the French Communist Party who sat in on a crucial board meeting.'}, {'Page 288': 'Source: Archives of American Art Journal, vol. 25, no. 3, 1985, pp. 19-23.

During Pollock’s lifetime the Metropolitan Museum of Art was unwilling to pay $8,000 for Autumn Rhythm, but paid $30,000 for it the year after his death. In 1955, Pollock was listed as a speculative (growth) investment by Fortune magazine. However, around 1950, according to Tony Smith, Pollock’s total income for the year had been only $2,600.

Selz was then, as he is now, sensitive to the resistance shown by the still insular New York art establishment to major talents such as Mark Tobey and Morris Graves, both largely ignored, if not dismissed out of hand, because they were working. outside New York City (though they did exhibit there). It amounted almost to professional suicide to insist on plying the artist’s trade in regional backwaters such as the Pacific Northwest. The major critics, among them Clement Greenberg and Irving Sandler, sustained that prejudicial view of fone s work, despite his being mentioned as a source for Jackson Pollock’s “all over” imagery and “drip” technique. Pollock in fact admired Tobey, with whom he exhibited in two 1944 group shows. In a letter (undated, postmark 5 January 1946) to Portland artist Louis Bunce (the two met at the Art Students League in the 1930s when Bunce and Willem de Kooning were studio assistants of Arshile Gorky), Pollock wrote: “New York seems to be the only place in America where painting (in the real sense) can come thru. Tobey and Graves seem to be an exception.” And in a different letter: “Do you ever see Tobey or Graves? I still like their work a lot.” Quoted in Paul J.

A previously overlooked contemporary reference gives the original title of Siqueiros’s lithograph as Militant and the edition size as 150. See Aline Kistler, “Prints of the Moment,” Prints 7, no. 1 (October 1936), p. 53. Oles, in Portrait of a Decade, p. 98, reports that in 1960, when the artist Anton Refregier asked Siqueiros to sign a copy of the Militant lithograph, Siqueiros wrote a “statement on the print to the effect that it was not completely his work [and] that he had left the unfinished stone in his New York Workshop when he joined the International Brigade in Spain.” Presumably Miller or a workshop assistant made finishing touches to the zinc.

Chenault, in “Bradley Walker Tomlin: Early Paintings and Intimations,” Archives of American Art Journal, vol. 14, no. 3, 1974, p. 9, which is based on her doctoral dissertation (University of Michigan, 1971), writes that Tomlin “frequented Woodstock from around 1920 on.” For the three-man exhibition at the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts in February 1923, see the Tomlin papers, Archives of American Art, roll 19, frames 0367-0369. Tomlin’s trips to Europe were his scholarship voyage in 1923; his trip with London (1926-27); one to Spain, France, and England in 1928; and a trip to England on family business in 1934. The quotation is from “Syracuse Artist Calls Latin Quarter Folk Serious Strivers, Not Dawdlers,” Syracuse Herald, 26 July 1927. The quotation of 1940 is from the Tomlin papers, Archives of American Art, roll 19, frame 0387. Information about Tomlin’s later dissatisfaction with the Woodstock Artists Association came from an interview with Charlotte Collins, 23 January 1986; data concerning the commission is also from Mrs. Collins, who arranged the project for her aunt and uncle’s house, built from 1928 to 1930 or 1931, and who later donated the paintings to the Woodstock Artists Association. They were probably Tomlin’s last commercial works. After designing covers for House and Garden and Vogue, decorative screens, and even a dinner set for Macy’s in the 1920s, in the 1930s the artist turned to teaching as a source of income. Van der Loo’s letter, written from Woodstock, is in the Tomlin papers, Archives of American Art, roll 19, frame 0114.'}]"

The Armory Show contained 1,300 works in New York compared with more than 11,400 works of art in the Fine Arts Department at the PPIE.

The United States is rich in journals that explore themes in American art, ranging from early American portraiture to the latest gallery exhibits of American artists. One journal devoted to the early ait of America is Archives of American Art Journal (United States, Archives of American Art, 1950), focusing on the enormous collection at the Archives of Ameri¬ can Art, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution. Its collection includes the personal papers and other primary source materials of every major American artist, representing every period and style. Another journal of American painting, sculpture, decorative aits, photography, and architec¬ ture from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries is The American Art Journal (United States, Kennedy Galleries & Israel Sack Inc., 1969 ). Written by American art scholars, the journal is published by a prestigious New York gallery that specializes in this area. A third journal that ties in the art of the past with that of the present is American Art (United States, Na¬ tional Museum of American Art, 1987 ), formerly called Smithsonian Studies in American Art. Published by the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, it features painting, sculpture, graphics, deco¬ rative arts, and architecture from the seventeenth century to the present. Ar¬ ticles are written by art historians, essayists, and critics. Another prominent journal is Art in America (United States, Frederick Fairchild Sherman, 1913). It is devoted to all aspects of the arts, with an emphasis the current American art scene. While Art in America began as a periodical devoted to the study of European art in American collections, overtime, American art¬ ists were given more coverage in the journal. Today, it is considered to be the most comprehensive journal for the study of American contemporary art. Since 1982, a useful reference work, entitled “Guide to Galleries, Mu¬ seums, Artists” has been published as its August issue.'}, {'Page 462': 'Archives of American Art Journal [ISSN:0003-9853], 126 Archives of Asian Art [ISSN:0066-6637], 127 Archives of Dermatology [ISSN:0003-987X], 420 Archives of Disease in Childhood [ISSN:0003-9888], 423 Archives of General Psychiatry [ISSN:0003-990X], 423 Archives of Microbiology [ISSN:0302-8933], 393 Archives of Ophthalmology [ISSN:0003-9950], 422'}]"

To be true to all the facts, it should be noted that when Walter Pach selected the Nude for the Armory Show in November 1912, it had just been rehabilitated already. It was shown in October at the Salon de la Section d’Or, organized by the very same orthodox cubists, led by Marcel’s brother, Jacques Villon, who had rejected it form the Indépendants in March and were now only too eager to amend. But this first rehabilitation remained, in more than one sense, a family affair played out from within the cubist brotherhood. The “fathers” of cubism, Picasso and Braque, stayed away from all Salons and showed only contempt for institutional legitimation. Not so with the “sons,” Gleizes and Metzinger in particular, who attached great value to the incorporation of cubism into the great tradition and insisted on group discipline as a strategy of penetration. Marcel, the “prodigal son,’ would thus be reintegrated into the co-opted (i.e., self-proclaimed) avant-garde of orthodox cubism. The irony is that the Duchamp family was split on this occasion: while Raymond Duchamp-Villon showed at the Salon d’Automne, Jacques Villon, who was on its committee, resigned in protest against their hostility toward cubism and replied with the Salon de la Section d’Or, held simultaneously. And Marcel, not surprisingly, showed in both Salons but didn’t care. He already had the kind of “structuralist” understanding of the issue of artistic legitimation that is at the bottom of his algebraic comparisons: neither rejection from one Salon nor admission into a counter-Salon is pertinent in isolation, since both Salons form a couple leaving the public on the sidelines. True legitimation—or, in the case of the Nude, rehabilitation—would have to involve the public. And this is what happened at the Armory Show. One more fact, which seems to complete the interplay of commissioned symmetries: in April 1912, right after the Independants and months before the Salon de la Section d’Or, the Nude was included in a cubist group show and sent to Barcelona where it didn’t raise an eyebrow, just as the first readymades shown'}]"

It was exhibited at the second PostImpressionist Exhibition at the Grafton Galleries, London, in 1912 (cat. no. 26) and at the 1913 Armory Show in New York, where it was the most frequently reproduced and most discussed picture of the eight Matisses shown. Responses to it were usually quite negative. Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., wrote that “The torso is swung in with a quite magnificent gesture that ignores all details; for the rest, a coarse emphasis of the intentness of the face, raw color, mean surfaces — a prodigal expenditure of violent means to achieve a passing and negligible effect” (“Old and New Art,” The Nation [6 March 1913], 241). In another review, Mather referred to the picture’s “wilful if powerful distortions, a childish symbolism, fairly appalling ugliness” (“Newest Tendencies in Art,” The Independent [6 March 1913], 509). It was also caricatured as being by “Gyp the Futurist” (see Archives of American Art Journal 27, 2 [1987], 24, and Jo Davidson, “The Extremists: An Interview,” Arts & Decoration [March 1913], 170— 71, 180).'}]"

By the way, that is a small group. Most of them are in their mid to late forties now. As I have said, I came to poetry through my art, and my sensibil¬ ity was very much formed in the sixties. I seem to have been led into writing by accident, the same way my writing then led me into textual scholarship, and now I find myself writing something you might call film criticism. I have never followed an agenda or a program. Also, much of my inspiration as a poet comes from mod¬ ernist writers. At first Charles Olson (a late modernist or first postmodernist) gave me a certain permission. The early edition of the Maximus Poems IV, V, VI pub¬ lished by Golliard was crucial. I would open it up, and what he was doing with the space of a page and with history would set me off. Finnegans Wake is another work that was necessary to me. And then there was John Cage and what he did with Finnegans Wake. For a couple of years I had a correspondence with Ian Hamilton Finlay because I had written an article for the Archives of American Art Journal about artists and poets (Ad Reinhardt, Robert Lax, and Ian Hamilton Finlay). Fin¬ lay is one of the great letter writers. He had me following all sorts of leads and all of them very much affected what I was doing. These people all influenced me on a formal level. Virginia Woolf and Emily Dickinson were there as the two com¬ pletely necessary guides in ways that were immediate — absolutely necessary, not at a remove but in me.'}]"

However, it was demonstrably in the Gimbel’s department-store exhibition in Milwaukee (see pp. 17-18) before the Armory Show closed its Boston showing. Close to forty years after he had been approached by the emissaries of the Armory Show in 1912 and the organizers of the Gimbel’s exhibition in early 1913, Léger must have confused these two events. Aaron Sheon, “1913: Forgotten Cubist Exhibitions in America,” Arts Magazine (New York) 57 no. 7 (March 1983): 103, points out that Essai pour trois portraits could not have been in the Armory Show because of the conflict in dates with the Gimbel’s exhibition. Sheon argues that La Femme en bleu was one of the works in the Armory Show, based on the cartoon spoofing this painting in the Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph, May 7, 1913, which almost undoubtedly appeared because of the painting’s inclusion in the Armory Show.

The editorial board’s shift towards modernism was made partly as a result of pressure which had been brought to bear by some modernist members of the Union — Solman, Ilya Bolotowsky, Balcomb Greene, Mark Rothkowitz, Byron Browne, George McNeil, and others — and partly because the Popular Front made it necessary to open up the editorial board to modernism. The move did not go uncontested. Rosenberg’s place was secured at the expense of Solman’s and Spivak’s and several others, and then only on the advice of a visiting official of the French Communist Party who sat in on a crucial board meeting.'}]"
