The rapidly growing interest in American art in the post-war pe� riod and the desire to acknowledge and assess the nation�s cultural history led to increasing scholarly concern, which was, however, hampered by a scarcity of readily accessible documentation. During the early 1950s, when E. P. Richardson, then Director of the Detroit Institute of Arts, was work� ing on his Painting in America: The Story of 450 Years (New York, 1956), he found that �there was an up-to-date, useful book on only one out of ten of the artists whom I wished to discuss.� A group of scholars and business� men headed by Richardson and the Detroit collector, Lawrence A. Fleischman, then organized the Archives of American Art to, in Richardson�s words, �collect material that will be used by writers and scholars in inter� preting American civilization, material for the study of those men and women who have given us our artistic heritage� artists and craftsmen, col� lectors and art dealers, art institutions and writers on art. We are collecting it not for the sake of collecting but to use the information and put it to work.�'}, ",0.6650796

Cahill in the WPA pamphlet Federal Art Project Manual of October 1935 (see pp. 10-19), identifies ten �working procedures� (see p. 10), including a catch-all �Other� for the possibility of adding later efforts in drafting, chart and graph making, model making, stage and costume design, and so on (see p. 19). It is clear from our research that these ten �working procedures� (see p. 10) did not suit every state's needs. The Illinois Manual for Federal Project No. 1 of 15 December 1937 (see p. 4), indicated twelve project units: Mural Painting; Easel Painting; Sculpture; Applied Arts; Posters, Signs, etc.; Arts and Crafts; Photography; Lectures, criticism, and preparation of Catalogs and Pamphlets; Circulating exhibitions of art; Art teaching; Operation of experimental art galleries; Index of American Design; and Other. The Illinois Art Project had a variety of designations that were at variance with the J/linozs Manual. Early letters, such as one from Holger Cahill to Increase Robinson 5 February 1936, DC61 Archives of American Art and another, Increase Robinson to Thomas Parker 14 October 1936, DC61 Archives of American Art, used �projects� to designate the artistic endeavors (Easel, Mural, Sculpture, Diorama, and Poster Projects) and, equally confusing, the IAP itself. A flyer, �Many Chicago Artists Employed by W.P.A.,� August 1936, Chicago Public Library, indicated nine �departments.� Clark Sommer Smith in his �Nine Years of Federally Sponsored Art in Chicago: 1933-1942,� master�s thesis, University of Chicago, 1965, states from a 1938 Art Institute catalogue, Art for the Public, that there were twelve �Divisions� of the IAP (see p. 18).

Later, with its own staff, its well-established identity, and its more energetic (and highly successful) search for the records of American artists and art institutions, the Archives encountered the dilemma common to all archival and manuscript repositories: how to achieve an appropriate balance between the feasible and the ideal in its card catalogue.'}, ",0.6608187

More than ten million items of original source material are available for study to scholars, students, writers, and other researchers. A bureau ue Smithsonian Institution since 1970, the Archives preserves its original documents in Washington, D.C. The most actively used collections are microfilmed, and microfilm copies are deposited at the Archives centers in Washington, New York, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, and San Marino, California. The original material is thus protected from loss or destruction while copies are readily accessible to scholars in the centers or through inter-library loan. The Archives has not only the records of American painters, sculptors, craftsmen, collectors, and dealers, but also those of critics, historians, curators, museums, societies, and other institutions concerned with art in America.'}, ",0.66125333

What remains now belongs to the Archives of American Art in Washington, D.C. Weidman built on Kirstein�s initial research and completed a Ph.D. dissertation in 1982 that was published the following year as a seven-volume, catalogue raisonn� of Rimmer�s oeuvre. It is invaluable as an extensively detailed record of what could be discovered about Rimmer and his attributed work at the time. One of Weidman and Kirstein�s greatest contributions is their recording of information received from Rimmer�s descendants. I would like to acknowledge Jeffrey�s kind assistance in allowing me to see some of the questionable-attribution images sent to him since his book�s publication (none convincing as by Rimmer) as well as copies of Rimmer�s surviving musical compositions (unfortunately mostly illegible) in his possession.'}, ",0.682361

As early as 1929, the first index to biographies of Amer� ican artists was compiled by Ralph Clifton Smith. His Biographical Index of American Artists (D.86.) was reprinted in 1976 and continues to provide guidance for pre-1900 artists. In 1918, Frank Chase published an early bibliography in this area, his Bibliography of American Art and Artists Before 1835 (A. 33.), and although later bibliographies have somewhat superseded his work, it is still worthy of note. In 1972, Garnett McCoy compiled a guide to the Archives of American Art in Washington which offers a listing of original letters, papers, and documents by and about American artists. Titled The Archives of American Art: A Directory of Re� sources (A. 80.), it provides a guide to primary source materials otherwise difficult to locate. In 1979 and 1980, two other comprehensive bibliog� raphies on American art were produced, the first by Karpel, The Arts in America: A Bibliography (A. 69.), and the second called Olana\'s Guide to American Artists (A. 90.), a two-volume work modestly subtitled by its author, a ""contribution toward a bibliography."" In 1984, a new guide from the Archives of American Art was published that offers access to its oral history collections, taped and recorded interviews with the artists and others close to them.

AAA workers also salvaged many art project records which remained in the states and conducted tape recorded interviews with many surviving artists and administrators. Then in 1966 the Ford Foundation grant expired before the work was completed. At the time of writing a considerable part of the AAA collection is closed and will remain so until the organization acquires money and manpower to index the mass of material and arrange it in workable order. The taped interviews which are presently available are uneven in quality, and one wishes that more of the AAA interviewers had approached the successful alumni of federal projects with something more positive and provocative than: �Is there anything you want to say about the government art projects?�'}]",0.7282963

"Winslow Homer and Homer family papers from the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, 1846-1954","'Page 10': 'There is a vast amount of primary material available on Homer, and our work simply could not have been done without the assistance of those who work in institutions that hold large col� lections of Homer�s drawings, letters, and related objects. Elaine Dee and Marilyn F. Symmes of the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution, New York, have been unfailingly generous in allowing us access to and providing information about that museum�s un� equaled collection of Homer drawings; Brad Nugent handled our many requests for photographs. Mattie Kelley at the Bowdoin College Museum of Art has, with seemingly unending patience and good humor, helped us with that institution�s vast material, including original letters, scrap� books, and photographs. And when one thinks of Bowdoin and Homer, Philip C. Beam�s name also comes immediately to mind. We not only gained much from his knowledge of the Bowdoin material and of Homer, but were privileged to spend a delightful day with him touring Prout�s Neck, seeing the places that Homer painted and the house and studio in which he worked. That one still has the opportunity to see Homer�s studio is thanks to the efforts of his descendants, of whom we particularly thank Doris Homer and Lois Homer Graham. M. Knoedler and Company in New York, which served as Homer�s primary dealer late in his career, also has rich holdings of letters and transcripts documenting the artist�s relationship with the firm; Melissa DeMedeiros, Knoedler�s librarian, kindly made that material available to us and answered many, many ques� tions. Colonel Merl M. Moore shared with us his large file of copies of contemporary exhibition reviews of Homer�s works, and was especially helpful with references from the Boston Transcript. We also made use of materials available through the Archives of American Art, the Boston Public Library and the National Gallery�s own holdings of transcripts of letters from Homer to his friends, family, and dealers.'}, ",0.7422628

Librarians, archivists, and historians at the following institutions gave me important assistance: the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the Archives of American Art and the Inventory of American Painting (at the Smithsonian Institution), the National Library of Medicine, the Jefferson Medical College Archives of Thomas Jefferson University, the Alumni As� sociation of Jefferson Medical College, the Biblioth^ue Nationale, the New York Public Library, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Academy of Music of Philadelphia, and the Camden County Historical Society. Curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts were generous with their time. In Philadelphia, Seymour Adelman was particularly helpful, as were Darrel Sewell at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Frederick B. Wagner, Jr., M.D., Grace Revere Osier Professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College; at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Peter J. Olch, M.D. gave valuable encouragement.

My students at the University of Maryland, in an Eakins seminar in 1980 and in general lecture courses, asked valuable questions that kept me attentive to many points of view. I owe an unending debt to colleagues who read and criticized my manuscript in various stages.

My research was funded by generous grants from the General Research Board of the University of Maryland, the Amer� ican Council of Learned Societies, the Wyeth Endowment of American Art, and by a year�s Postdoctoral Fellowship with the Smithsonian Institution. Librarians, archivists, and historians at the following institutions gave me important assistance: the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the Archives of American Art and the Inventory of American Painting (at the Smithsonian Institution), the National Library of Medicine, the Jefferson Medical College Archives of Thomas Jefferson University, the Alumni As� sociation of Jefferson Medical College, the Bibliotheque Nationale, the New York Public Library, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Academy of Music of Philadelphia, and the Camden County Historical Society. Curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts were generous with their time. In Philadelphia, Seymour Adelman was particularly helpful, as were Darrel Sewell at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Frederick B. Wagner, Jr., M.D., Grace Revere Osier Professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College; at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Peter J. Olch, M.D. gave valuable encouragement. Conserva� tors Sarah L. Fisher, Ross Merrill, and S. Ann Hoenigswald at the National Gallery of Art, Dianne Dwyer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and, most prominently, Marion Mecklenburg of the Washington Conservation Studio helped me immensely in studying Eakins� technique. My students at the University of Maryland, in an Eakins seminar in 1980 and in general lecture courses, asked valuable questions that kept me attentive to many points of view. I owe an unending debt to colleagues who read and criticized my manuscript in various stages. At the Smithsonian Institution, Lois Eink, Judith Zilczer, Phyllis Rosenzweig, and William Truettner gave encouraging support and advice; Lillian Miller and Ellen Miles offered valuable sugges-'}, ",0.69003177

"Statement on an exhibit of the Washington Art Association, ca. 1860","'Page 123': 'Of the numerous recollections by contemporaries of the acad� emy�s founding, the blow-by-blow encounter between the Amer� ican Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Academy, as described by William Dunlap in chapter 8, volume 3, of his book, A History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States (Boston: C. E. Goodspeed and Co., 1918; first published, 1834), is of special interest. As the senior member of the founders of the academy, sixty-year-old Dunlap was strongly protective of the ideals professed by the young artists who orga� nized the new institution. A historical perspective on these con� troversies is presented in a study by Theodore Sizer, entitled �The American Academy of the Fine Arts,� included in volume 1 of the two-volume reference, American Academy of Fine Arts and American Art-Union, by Mary Bartlett Cowdrey (New York: New-York Historical Society, 1953). Additional material by Sizer pertaining to the topic is available on microfilm in the Archives of American Art. Another relevant essay in the same volume is �The American Art-Union,�� by Charles E. Baker, discussed in footnote 28 to the essay. One of the more lively of the many ac� counts of the founding in popular nineteenth-century periodicals'}, ",0.678611
"Passedoit Gallery exhibition catalogs, 1936-1959","'Page 124': 'Catalogs of the academy exhibitions contain various types of useful information. Basically, each contains addresses of exhibi� tors and prices for some of the works. In the nineteenth century, quotations that were intended to reinforce the mood of a picture are frequently included. Beginning with the 1877 annual � one of the most controversial and important exhibitions � the catalogs are illustrated. Dimensions of illustrated paintings are given, a type of data that one wishes were included consistently through� out the catalogs to help make identification of specific works more accurate. Beginning in 1880 and for a number of years thereafter the issues are supplemented with biographical notes on certain artists and descriptions of their works, written by Charles M. Kurtz. In addition, accounts of various aspects of the academy and its activities occasionally appear, as, for example, that on the founding and the early members in the 1885 catalog. Sometimes too, as in this same catalog, information is given on New York museums, private collections, and sales galleries. Beginning in the 1890s the covers of the academy�s exhibition catalogs were graced by a female figure in Grecian gown, with palette in hand. She was drawn by Will H. Low, who drew similar classical female figures for the catalog covers of the con� current exhibitions of the Society of American Artists. From the late nineties the issues of the academy�s catalogs frequently list all previous prize winners at the spring annuals; catalogs of the winter exhibitions include names of previous prize winners at the winter events. Periodically, announcements promote the academy schools, as in the 1898 catalog. From the 1910s names of faculty members are listed with the dates of the current school sessions. More recent catalogs, up to the present year, continue the longestablished practice of listing all members of the academy, past and present, including the founders and the presidents, with the dates of their terms. In addition, they include the addresses of current exhibitors and reproductions of certain works. A fairly complete collection of the catalogs is in the Library of Congress; the New-York Historical Society has the complete series from 1826. In the Archives of American Art several sources of ma� terials on microfilm include academy catalogs.'}, ",0.6577252

Donated to the archives by Watson�s widow, artist Nan Watson, and microfilmed in eleven reels, D47 to D57, the Forbes Watson Papers contain correspondence, drafts of articles and lectures, newspaper and magazine clippings, photographs, and exhibition catalogs. The largest group of papers pertains to the 1930s and 1940s, with relatively Httle from Watson�s early years. The papers also include several drafts of reminiscences for a book Watson worked on but did not complete; unfortunately, these are extremely fragmentary. The Forbes Watson Papers are grouped together roughly by period but are not arranged chronologically. Many of the documents are undated, and pages of individual docu� ments are not necessarily sequential, which sometimes creates difficulties in develop� ing a coherent biographical line. Used in conjunction with other papers of artists, deal� ers, and art commentators in the archives, a chronological framework can be constructed, and a social and artistic milieu emerges with some clarity. The papers of Olin Dows, Edward B. Rowan, George Biddle, Isabella Howland, Concetta Scaravaglione, Guy Pene du BoisTCeonKroU, Henry Schnakenberg, and Wendell Jones are particularly valuable for this purpose. For specific topics and issues, the papers of Ernest Fiene, David Fredenthal, Max Weber, Henry McBride, Julian E.

There is of course a vital distinction between evidence that is contemporary to the events being described, such as personal letters, and information taken from interviews and memoirs, in which the same events are seen with the perspective of intervening years. This book attempts to weave together diverse facts without obliterating their individual shadings. Thus Porter�s opinions in 1968 are clearly identified as such and do not serve as surrogates for what he may have thought in 1928.

This archive would make it possible for another scholar to reconstruct Porter�s sales after 1952 in greater detail than I have gone into here. The Porter family still possesses numerous original letters written by his mother, Ruth Porter, as well as two notebooks (cited in notes as APL and APL2), containing extracts from Anne Porter�s letters to her mother, Katharine Channing. Finally, | can recommend an overlooked source for information on American artists: their high-school and college transcripts. There is no telling what may turn up in the files preserved in perpetuity in a Registrar�s office: Porter�s entrance application to Harvard is a time capsule of his state of mind in 1923.

Approximately three hundred thousand people saw the Armory Show in New York, Chicago, and Boston versus the ten million visitors estimated to have visited the Palace of Fine Arts. The Armory Show contained 1,300 works in New York compared with more than 11,400 works of art in the Fine Arts Department at the PPIE. The Armory Show ran for roughly three months total in its three venues, while the PPIE was open for fourteen months, including the post-Exposition period. See Darcy Tell, �The Armory Show at 100: Primary Documents,� Archives of American Art Journal 51, nos. 3-4 (Spring 2013): 15; and Frank Morton Todd, The Story of the Exposition: Being the Official History of the International Celebration Held at San Francisco in r915 to Commemorate the Discovery of the Pacific Ocean and the Construction of the Panama Canal (New York: G. P. Putnam�s Sons, 1921), 4:10. Both exhibitions benefited from major publicity campaigns to advertise and explain the art on view. One article claimed that publicity for the PPIE surpassed that of all previous world�s fairs combined: �Exposition Ranks as World�s Most Advertised Event,� San Francisco Examiner, February, 21, 1915. Brown, Story, 133-142.

More than thirty-five artists and activists have shared their memories with me. Others revealed their stories in the records of archival collections, including the Smithsonian Institution�s Archives of American Art. Listening to�these recollections, reading their words, not only offered evidence of diverse individual experiences in larger historical trajectories, but also steered me away from the easy synthesis of topdown histories. Having to connect the lives of my interviewees with the creation of their art, the work of their peers, the history of Latino social movements, and the history of San Francisco proved a challenge. My comparative analysis of these experiences led me to identify shared trajectories, just as my methodology sensitized me to issues of dissension, difference, and exclusion. Ultimately, there is no glib statement to define decades of creativity. However, there is in this book a desire to show how the Mission emerged as an influential physical space for a profoundly creative and politically active Latino arts community.'}, ",0.7004986

His New England her� itage at first made him wary of any kind of collecting. �It breathes of selfindulgence,� he wrote, while �self-denial is our Puritan goal.� However, he equivocated, in the mid-twentieth century, �not to be a collector may be as sinful as to be one.� His trust fund did not extend to subsidizing artists, but, �quite selfishly,� he determined to collect the works of artists barely emerging from obscurity. In 1952 he had started buying art hap� hazardly, but he soon began to focus on abstract art, including works by Hans Hofmann, Georges Mathieu, and Robert Motherwell. In December 1955, he had bought a Jackson Pollock, a Franz Kline, and a Jean Dubuffet �from sheer enthusiasm, and at greater cost.� The Pollock he had bought for $2,500, Arabesque, was worth around $15 million when it starred in a MoMA restrospective in 1998. When Baker�s collection was shown at the Yale University Art Gallery that year, it included an acquisition from 1961, a time, he wrote, when �few people . . . would ever wish to own a canvas by Roy Lichtenstein.� Baker had bought Washing Machine for $500; a year later, he bought Lichtenstein�s signature piece Blam! for less than $1,000.'}, ",0.6515647

These documents are now preserved, respectively, in the Collection Archive of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the Archives of American Art, both part of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. A full account of the discovery of these papers and a description of their contents appear in the introduction. These documents, including almost complete records as well as diverse memorabilia of the Association and the Exhibition, made it possible to reconstruct the historic events from the birth of the Association, through the Show itself, to the demise of the Association, as well as all the repercussions caused in cultural and popular circles. The facts and the attendant relationships have been fairly accurately established,'}, ",0.6751065

Dealing exclusively with those activities, the letters are nonetheless very private, though they deal with a public event; they are also psychologically revealing in unsuspected ways. However, they add very little to our previous knowledge of the events. These letters as well as the more formal documents of the Association were in Kuhn�s possession when he wrote his own account entitled The Story of the Armory Show, and the letters reveal some aspects of his relationships that he preferred to suppress (for more information about these letters, see my article in the Archives of American Art Journal, Winter 1987-88).

"The story of the Armory Show / by Walt Kuhn, 1938","'Page 16': 'Walt Kuhn was aware that he had all the secretary�s records, since he must have used them to write his story of the event. He denied them to me, perhaps because he did not know me and because there were things among the papers that might reopen the wounds of the old unpleasantness surrounding the dissolution of the Association. Kuhn made no mention of the falling-out in his account, and Myers closed his chapter on the Armory Show, �As always, time has smoothed out whatever differences there may have been, and the Armory Show remains a great tradition in our art history.� All of them seem to have recognized the fact that the Exhibition had an importance far beyond their personal disagreements, and perhaps Kuhn did not want to rake the embers of an old dispute while some of the members were still alive. It is only in the past year that Brenda Kuhn has bequeathed these papers to the Archives of American Art and thus made them available to the public.'}, ",0.6518619

In order to raise money to carry on the restoration of the Holley House, the Greenwich Historical Society decided to sell the material pertaining to the Armory Show to the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Collection. Early in 1962, I was commissioned to publish these papers as a memorial volume on the fiftieth anniversary of the Armory Show. It seemed at that time a limited project that could be completed and published by February 17, 1963, fifty years after the date of the Armory Show opening. | began work in June and almost immediately learned from the June Bulletin of the Archives of American Art that the Kuhn Papers had come to light. A hurried trip to Detroit and an examination of the papers indicated that the original plan to publish the MacRae Papers as a separate entity no longer made sense. Both sources together now could supply the documentary information for an almost complete archaeological reconstruction of the Association and the Armory Show. This was an exciting possibility, but time had become a major consideration.'}, ",0.7088899

Artists were selected through competition, not on the basis of need. In 1935, the government also established the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration and the Treasury Relief Art Project, funded by the Works Progress Administration. These programs awarded financial assistance to artists in need by providing them stipends to paint murals and easel pictures.

The Archives of American Art and the Smithsonian Institution Press were kind enough to give permission to reprint the information from Arts in America in this new format.

While Glackens was an artist with whose work I was familiar, I have now come to a new understanding and appreciation of his significance for the history of American art and a greater recognition of his central role in . that history�a role that was recognized by many critics, writers, and fellow artists during his lifetime. I owe special gratitude to Carole Pesner and Katherine Kaplan of the Kraushaar Galleries in New York, and to John Surovek of Palm Beach, Florida�the dealers who represent the Glackens estate. Susan Conway of Washington, D.C. generously made the Glackens Archives in her possession available, and without them this study would not have been possible in the form it has taken. Nancy I.

The final exhibition was catalogued as the Tenth Memorial Exhibition of Paintings by William Glackens; however, the shows ran sequentially for nine years, the seventh annual occurring in November 1945 and the Ninth Annual in November 1946.

It is available upon request from the Midwest Area Center of the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, which is located at The Detroit Institute of Arts. The extensive length of this checklist, comprised of approximately three hundred works from which the eighty examples of public art in this book were selected, is evidence, of course, of the vast array of public art in our midst. This surprising number of public artworks in a city that is often and mistakenly stereotyped as only capable of making automobiles forces one to re-evaluate the actual character of Detroit. As is true of any modern urban complex, one has to look beneath surfaces for the true character or nature of a place. While Detroit seems to have been more interested in its future than its past, and perhaps at times even more cavalier in its treatment of history than other cities, it does in fact possess many observable traditions, including that of public art. This book, then, celebrates the variety and vitality, toughness and sensitivity, past and future, of a great city.'}]",0.6515216

Since the time those words were written, much new primary documentation on American art has become accessible, but the paucity of records about the Whitney Studio and Studio Club was an obstacle that had to be surmounted. Although Juliana Force was not one to save papers, many artists who were regular exhibitors at the Whitney did.

Without the invaluable collections of the Archives and the expertise and enthusiasm of its staff, I could not have attempted a biography of Juliana Force.

And so, the material languished, but it was pre� sented to the Archives of American Art, where I had the op� portunity to consult it.

Al� though many of the innumerable details were irrelevant to Eakins as an artist, the book was the most complete biography so far. In his Preface the author deplored what he considered the lack of accurate biographical information in previous writings on Eakins, saying: �It was a recognition of this state of af� fairs � the relatively small amount of work done and even that flawed by lack of documentation � that led to my own work. . . . The facts must be set down, their sources given, and fact cleanly separated from opinion.� Unfortunately, however, the book contains numerous errors in what are purported to be facts, including facts easily verifiable from original sources.

The efficiently organized Archives of American Art provided me with my main source of unpublished material: I would like to thank the staff of their offices in New York, Boston, and Washington, and in particular Bill McNaught and Bob Brown. The following were also of great assistance: Doreen Bolger Burke of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; Eleanor Crowley of the Ipswich Public Library, Ipswich, Massachusetts; the staff of the Hirschl and Adler Gallery, New York; Ronald McKnight Melvin, director of the Terra Museum of Art, Evanston, Illinois; and Joseph Amarotico and Kathy Stover both at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia. I am particularly indebted to David and Anne Sellin, who have helped the book in numerous ways, not least by directing me to important American archival sources. I have talked to many people about their personal memories of Provincetown, including Emily Dickinson, Stanley Kunitz, Chris Magreel, Myron Stout, the late Jack Tworkoff, Brita Walker, Hazel Hawthorne Werner, and Tessim Zorach. Bruce McKain not only supplied me with colourful anecdotes about his teacher, Charles Hawthorne, but also introduced me to Provincetown's Beachcomber's Club. Reggie Cabral, proprietor of the infamous A-House bar at Provincetown, brought the town vividly to life for me through his recollections, and offered me a privileged glimpse of his unsurpassed collection of literature, paintings, and memorabilia relating to the colony; with remarkable generosity he also gave me a copy of the exceedingly rare Lorelei magazine, which includes the map reproduced on p. 179.

Since then several important books on Hartley have appeared, including a monograph, Gail Scott�s Marsden Hartley (New York: Abbeville Press, 1988); Jeanne Hokin�s Pinnacles and Pyramids: The Art of Marsden Hartley (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1993), which focuses on Hartley's persistent exploration of the theme of the mountain; and a biography, Townsend Ludington�s Marsden Hartley: The Biography of an American Artist (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1992). 2.

A fourth volume of poetry, Selected Poems, was published two years after his death, in 1945, and recently several more volumes of his writings have been published: a collection of essays, On Art, ed. Gail Scott (New York: Horizon Press, 1982); a prose-poem, Cleophas and His Own, A North Atlantic Tragedy, (Halifax: Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, 1982); and The Collected Poems of Marsden Hartley, 1904-1943, ed. Gail Scott (Santa Rosa, CA: Black Sparrow Press, 1987). 6. Other evidence includes (a) the fact that, of the three, SAPI corresponds most closely to the description of the autobiographical writing embodied in Hartley�s letters to Norma Berger; and (b) a typescript version of only one of the handwritten manuscripts also exists at Yale�and again it is SAPI. It does not seem to have been typed by Hartley, and very likely was typed by Norma, possibly after Hartley's death. In any event it would seem that this typist (Norma?) privileged the papers identified here as SAPI over the other, mostly later, segments of SAP in Hartley's""}]",0.6712058

I was present at the Huntington Art Gallery for that series and made a mental note as to his qualifications to write such a history A year later we finally met, and, after several discussions with both Dijkstra and Andrea, we decided to divide the history section between them, Dijkstra taking his specialty, the period from 1920-1950, and Andrea bringing us through the 1950s to the present. This supplement, like the book itself, is the first of its kind. I hope it will add to the accurate understanding and appreciation of our art community, giving readers new insights into the sporadic attempts by San Diego artists to shape a better cultural environment for themselves and their neighbors.'}, ",0.65823174

A curator at The Art Institute of Chicago, Sweet helped contextualize the artist�s work by considering it alongside that of her male contemporaries John Singer Sargent and James McNeill Whistler. His 1954 exhibition �Sargent, Whistler, and Mary Cassatt� (he evidently felt he needed to include her first name to clarify her gender) inscribed Cassatt on the roster of important nineteenthcentury American expatriate painters. Although some critics who saw this exhibition deemed her contributions to be lesser than Sargent�s and Whistler�s, it was Cassatt�s life and career that Sweet chose to pursue further. In 1966 he published a full-length biography, Miss Mary Cassatt: Impression� ist from Pennsylvania. Citing data gleaned from interviews with members of Cassatt�s family and from previously unpublished letters, he captured the artist�s genteel character and a sense of the life some� one of her elite social standing could enjoy. Not only did his efforts result in establishing a solidly researched chronology of the artist�s life, but he also made his archival work available to future schol� ars when he deposited his papers with the Archives of American Art (Smithsonian Institution), Washington, D.C.'}, ",0.66031694
